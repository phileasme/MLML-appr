# Yeast-MLML (WIP)
Pytorch implementation of the model described in the following paper:
 -   [Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6977055)  by Baoyuan Wu, Zhilei Liu, Shangfei Wang, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji

 "We formulate MLML as a transductive learning problem, where the goal is to recover the full label assignment for each sample by enforcing consistency with available label assignments and smoothness of label assignments. Along with an exact solution, we also provide an effective and efficient approximated solution"
